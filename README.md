# COSMOS-Summer-Research-UC-Davis-

California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science is an intensive four-week summer residential Pre-College Program for high school students who have demonstrated an aptitude for academic and professional careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. These talented and motivated students have the opportunity to work with renowned faculty, researchers, and scientists in state-of-the-art facilities while exploring advanced STEM topics far beyond the courses usually offered in California high schools. COSMOS fosters its students’ interests, skills, and awareness of educational and career options in STEM fields through challenging curricula that are both hands-on and lab-intensive.

# This statement provides context to the attached research paper titled 
“Graphene: The Material Transforming the World of Photovoltaics”

I conducted my research at the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science at UC Davis from July 8th – August 4th 2018. I performed independent research under the guidance of Dr. Jesús M. Velázquez. I gave a formal presentation on my research at the end of the program and received a Best Presentation Award for my research display. My research explored the potential for graphene, in combination with molybdenum diselenide, to produce a novel effective solar cell that is flexible and economical; this new technology can be very beneficial for developing countries without an effective energy grid, such as Ethiopia.
